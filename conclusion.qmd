# Conclusion

This project on New York City’s housing affordability and vacancy patterns reveals that NYC’s housing problems stem from long-term structural and macro-level forces, but not just short-term market changes. Vacancy rates have stayed extremely low for more than thirty years, which means the city has a persistent housing supply constraint. At the same time, rents have grown much faster than household incomes, especially after 2010, creating a growing affordability gap that affects both low-income and many middle-income renters. This pattern corresponds to the larger economic trends such as rising inequality, slower wage growth, and increasing demand for urban housing.

Our analysis also shows that many "vacant" units are actually unavailable because of renovation, seasonal use, or legal and structural issues. That means, the tight rental market is structural, not the result of owners intentionally keeping units empty. The weak relationship between affordability and vacancy further shows that solving the affordability crisis will likely require increasing housing supply or addressing the imbalance between rent and income, rather than focusing only on vacancy rates. Even though the dataset has limitations, such as missing details for privacy and inconsistent variables across years, this project helped us understand how local housing patterns are shaped by broader economic forces. If we continued this work, I would bring in more macro-level indicators or compare NYC with other cities to understand how national economic trends influence local housing challenges.
