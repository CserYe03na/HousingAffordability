# Introduction

  Housing affordability has been a major issue in many U.S. cities, especially in New York, where the population is very dense and people move frequently. Vacancy rates help us to understand both the housing market and how people make housing choices. When the vacancy rate is very low, it can mean that there are not enough affordable units and renters face strong competition. When the vacancy rate goes up, it may show changes in neighborhood desirability, unit conditions, or even broader economic trends.

  In this project, we use data from 1991 to 2023, including unit characteristics, occupancy status, rent, mortgage, and household demogrphic information, to study New York City's recent occupancy pattern and how NYC's housing affordability have changed over time. First, we describe the overall vacancy trends across time and sub-boroughs. Then, we analyze structural factors related to vacancy, such as affordability, rent levels, and physical housing characteristics. We use tools like vacancy reason distributions and PCA to identify important patterns. Finally, we examine how demographic groups and income levels relate to different housing choices, and how broader affordability measures, such as housing burden or the rent–income ratio, are connected to macroeconomic conditions.

  Overall, our goal is to better understand how housing conditions, residents' preferences, and economic forces jointly shape the occupancy patterns in New York City.
