# Introduction

Housing affordability has been a major issue in many U.S. cities, especially in New York, where the population is very dense and people move frequently. Vacancy rates help us to understand both the housing market and how people make housing choices. When the vacancy rate is very low, it can mean that there are not enough affordable units and renters face strong competition. When the vacancy rate goes up, it may show changes in neighborhood desirability, unit conditions, or even broader economic trends.

In this project, we use data from 1991 to 2017, including occupancy status (OCC), household weights, rent, and income, to study how NYC’s vacancy patterns have changed over time. First, we describe the overall vacancy trends across boroughs and neighborhoods. Then, we look at structural factors related to vacancy, such as affordability, rent levels, and physical housing characteristics. We use tools like vacancy reason distributions and PCA to identify important patterns. Finally, we examine how demographic groups and income levels relate to different housing choices, and how vacancy trends connect to broader affordability indicators like housing burden or the rent–income ratio.

Overall, our goal is to better understand how market forces, housing conditions, and residents’ preferences together shape the occupancy patterns in New York City.
